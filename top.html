<p>Hi Guide.</p>
<p><b>How to Buy the Right SSD: A Guide for 2019</b></p>
<p>The easiest way to hobble a fast CPU is to pair it with slow storage. While your processor can handle billions of cycles per second, it spends a lot of time waiting for your drive to feed it data. Hard drives are particularly sluggish because they have moving parts and platters that have to spin up. To get optimal performance you need a good solid state drive (SSD)</p>

<p><b>How much can you spend?</b></p>
<p>Most consumer drives range from 120GB to 2TB. While 120GB drives are the cheapest, they aren't roomy enough to hold a lot of software and are usually slower than their higher-capacity counterparts. It costs as little as $10 (£7) extra to step up from 120 to 250GB size, and that's money well spent. The delta between 250GB and 500GB drives can be slightly more, but 500GB is the sweet spot between price, performance and capacity for most users--particularly if you don't have the budget for a 1TB model.
There are also some drives (primarily from Samsung) with capacities above 2TB. But they’re typically expensive in the extreme (well over $500/£500), so they’re really only worthwhile for professional users who need space and speed and aren’t averse to paying for it.</p>
